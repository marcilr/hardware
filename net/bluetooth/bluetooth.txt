=============================
boothite:/home/marcilr/svn/uaa# apt-get install bluez-gnome

bluez-gnome is already the newest version.

Looks installed on boothite workstation already!

marcilr@boothite:~/svn/uaa$ dpkg -l  | grep bluez
ii  bluez-gnome                         0.6-1                                Bluetooth 
utilities for GNOME

For Bluetooth USB devices, the current driver is called hci_usb.
modprobe hci_usb 
boothite:/lib/modules/2.6.19-custom# lsmod | grep hci
hci_usb                21404  0 
bluetooth              62052  1 hci_usb

Starting to think there just isn't a bluetooth adapter.

  Never display icon
* Only display when adapter present
  Always display icon

The icon is displayed on the upper right toolbar.  However there doesn't appear 
to be any bluetooth adapter or the kernel is not configured for it.
